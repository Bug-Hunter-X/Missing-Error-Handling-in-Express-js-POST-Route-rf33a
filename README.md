# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling in POST request routes.  When a POST request is made without the required data or with malformed data, the application might crash or produce unexpected results.  This example shows how to identify and fix this issue.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js server with a POST route that processes user data.  However, it lacks error handling for scenarios where the request body is missing or invalid. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the server. It includes comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage missing or invalid user data, returning appropriate error responses to the client.
